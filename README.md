HTML Semantics and Accessibility

In this project, I used HTML semantics to improve accessibility in order to optimize SEO ranking for Horiseon.

Accessibility is a very important aspect of web development for these reasons:
1. Creates a product that more people can access using tools such as screen readers, allowing companies to reach a larger audience.
2. Creates a website with elements that make it clearer what type of content it contains increasing SEO ranking.
3. Makes code clearer for developers streamlining future edits.
